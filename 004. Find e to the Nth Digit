'''
Just like the previous problem, but with e instead of PI. Enter a number and have the program generate e up to that many decimal places. 
Keep a limit to how far the program will go

from math import e
n = int(raw_input("The number of decimal you want of e: "))
if 0 < n < 51:
    print '%.*f' % (n, e)
else:
    print raw_input("That's out of range, the number of decimal you want of e: ")
